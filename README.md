# matura

Here, you can find *working* examples (reference implementations maybe?)
of the Hungarian matura examination tasks, written in multiple programming
languages. The directories already contain the "sources"
(the input data to process, usually a text file).

The official tasks can be found at [oktatas.hu](https://www.oktatas.hu/kozneveles/erettsegi/feladatsorok).
